# AUTOCOACH
auto coaching for league. Currently just a yolov5 model to analyze Enemy_minimap, and Ally_minimap, currently pings enemy jungle on the minimap (if spotted). Has support for typing out where the enemy is aswell

# TODO
Intergrate API instead of manually inputing the chars in the game, GPT tips is implemented but very badly through tkinter in middle of the screen
