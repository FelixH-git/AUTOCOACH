# AUTOCOACH
auto coaching for league. Currently just a yolov5 model to analyze Enemy_minimap, and Ally_minimap and uses opencv to match champion icons onto detection by yolov5 model, currently pings enemy jungle on the minimap (if spotted). Has support for typing out where the enemy is aswell

# TODO
Intergrate API instead of manually inputing the chars in the game, GPT tips is implemented, but it is very bad (not included in repo) might upload
